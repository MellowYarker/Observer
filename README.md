# Observer

This software is designed to derive bitcoin addresses from *non-random* or *poorly generated* random private keys. These types of private keys are considered to be *weak*; any bitcoin associated with these types of addresses are at risk of being stolen.

See [*why randomness matters*](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters/).

### Purpose
Find and move bitcoin secured by weak keys before others with nefarious intentions try to, then offer the owner an easy and reliable way to reclaim the funds.

*Observer* will
* Generate and store a massive amount of weak private keys. [*Tool Nearly Complete*](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Observer/projects/1)
* Watch the bitcoin blockchain to see if any of the addresses in our database have funds. [*In Progress*](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Observer/projects/2)
* Move any discovered funds and offer the owner a way to reclaim them (*at a new secure address*). (**Not started**)

## WARNING
**Do not send bitcoin to addresses generated by this software**.

### How does it work?
You provide "*seeds*" that are turned into private keys. You can find lots of examples in [`src/100kseeds.txt`](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Observer/blob/master/src/100kseeds.txt) (*a collection of common passwords*). The private keys are used to generate `P2PKH`, `P2SH_P2WPKH`, and `P2WPKH` addresses, which are stored in a database along with the respective *seed* and *private key*.

You can easily add methods that convert seeds into private keys. *See the [wiki](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Observer/wiki/Seeds-and-Private-Keys) for more details.*

This software depends on [libbtc](https://github.com/libbtc/libbtc) (Bitcoin library written in C) and [libbloom](https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom) (C implementation of a bloom filter), they've both been added to this repo as git subtrees.

## Build
```bash
sudo sh configure.sh
cd src
make
```
You will be asked if you want to download previously used addresses, if you say yes, a set of +530 million addresses that were found on the blockchain will be downloaded and added to your local database. Unfortunately, this process can take hours to days depending on your hardware, so if you want to start generating key right away, just say *no* when asked about downloading addresses.

## Usage

This project isn't complete, the only fully functioning feature at the moment is the address generator, however, I'm working on reading transactions from the mempool and the UTxO set as new blocks come in.

To generate Bitcoin addresses:
```bash
./gen_keys <quantity of seeds> <input file>
```
For example
```
$ ./gen_keys 3000 100kseeds.txt
```

Key sets are stored in an sqlite3 table, here's a quick example of querying the database.
```bash
$ cd db
$ sqlite3 observer.db
SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
