# Observer - a Bitcoin address generator

There are 2 fundamental parts of this program, the first part is a fast address generator that takes non-random ascii seeds, the second part (not written yet) will watch the Bitcoin network to see if any addresses in Observer's database have or have had funds in them.

This project is slightly similar to the *Large Bitcoin Collider*, however instead of generating random keys as a pool in search of a collision, this software seeks to find addresses generated by non-random or poorly generated random private keys.

Check out the **projects** tab for details on features in development.

## WARNING
**Do not send bitcoin to addresses generated by this software** unless the seeds you supply the generator with are sufficiently random *and* you know what you're doing. See [why randomness matters](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters/).

### How does it work?
The program reads "seeds" from a text file (check out src/100kseeds.txt for some examples), turns them into private keys (by padding them with 0's), then generates the P2PKH, P2SH_P2WPKH, and P2WPKH that can be derived from the private keys. The results are stored in an sqlite3 database, and the private key is added to a bloom filter.

The textfile of seeds should be in the following format

    password
    123456
    hello123

When given a string, for example, "*password*", two 32 character private keys will be generated: 

    000...00password
    password00...000

This software depends on [libbtc](https://github.com/libbtc/libbtc) (Bitcoin library written in C) and [libbloom](https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom) (C implementation of a bloom filter), they've both been added to this repo as git subtrees.

## Build
```bash
sh configure.sh
cd src
make
```
The configure script will take some time since it configures and compiles 3 libraries.
Check the Makefile in src for more compile options.

## Usage
./gen_keys (quantity of seeds to read) (input file)

```bash
./gen_keys 3000 100kseeds.txt
```

Key sets are stored in an sqlite3 table, here's a quick example of querying the database.
```bash
$ cd db
$ sqlite3 observer.db
